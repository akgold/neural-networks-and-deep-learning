# Code samples for "Neural Networks and Deep Learning"

This code repository is forked from the excellent ebook ["Neural Networks
and Deep Learning"](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com).

The original author, Michal Daniel Dobrzanski, wrote code in Python to 
implement the algorithms in the book. I've re-implemented in R here.

I've also included answers to some of the exercises in the book where I 
bothered to write out.
